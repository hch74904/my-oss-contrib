This is the [Pull Request Page](https://github.com/freeCodeCamp/wiki/pull/1283).

This is a Github repo for contributing to [freeCodeCamp/wiki](https://github.com/freeCodeCamp/wiki), an open source projects for serving the current wiki forum of freeCodeCamp.

## About this project

**Why this project?**

I choose this project for the following reasons:
1. freeCodeCamp is a free community that helps people learn to code and the its forum is a good place to discuss question.
2. Not only disscussing coding questions, people also could get coding experience by contributing to open source projects used by nonprofits.
3. There is a freeCodeCamp study group in Omaha, so it is very closed to me!

**How active are the contributors on the project?**

There are over one hundred contributors in this projects. According the Github insigts, there were over 300 contributions to master on July 2016 and active contribution numbers until October 2016. Therefore, the contributors on this project are not active now. 

**What do you think you can contribute?**

There are not too many open issues about coding in the issues list of this project. However, I found that some wiki pages like "go", "python" are very simple, and I think I could add more information in these pages and create more wiki pages.

**What were your steps in choosing this project?**

At the beginning, I went through the projects in the Github explore page and found that most of projects were not friendly for beginners. In Katrina's article, she recommonded people started a familiar project, so I searched some popular projects by using "wiki" as the key word. I used word "wiki" because I think "wiki" open source projects could provide people free useful coding language knowledges and these projects are also easy to following. In the result of searching "wiki", I think freeCodeCamp should be a appropriate projects for me for the following reasons:
1. FreeCodeCamp Wiki had a very good starting. There are over 800 articles in current wiki forum and I think it is still extensible. 
2. There are over 300 contributers in this project and most of them are volunteers. Thus, I believe this project would be active in future.
